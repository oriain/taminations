<h2>Anything Concept</h2>

<p>Any call that begins with everyone doing a Circulate can be
modified by replacing the initial Circulate with another call. For
example, Chase Right Perk Up means Chase Right then complete the
remainder of Perk Up following the initial Circulate. A caller may add
"-er's" to the first call to emphasize it is all one call, e.g. Chase
Right-er's Perk Up. When the first call is some type of Circulate, the
word "Circulate" is conventionally omitted. For example, "Trade
Motivate" means Trade Circulate then complete the remainder of Motivate
following the initial Circulate. If the first call is Counter Rotate or
Split Counter Rotate, the "Rotate" is conventionally omitted. For
example, "Split Counter Coordinate" means Split Counter Rotate then
complete the remainder of Coordinate following the initial Circulate.
Calls modified in this way have the same number of parts as the base
call, with the entire (Anything) call replacing the first circulate.
This concept may be applied to any call that begins with a circulate
action, even if Circulate is not formally defined as the first part of
the call.</p>

<p>Calls that this concept is used with at C-2 are: Motivate, Coordinate,
Percolate, Perk Up.</p>
