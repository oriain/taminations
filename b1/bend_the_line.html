From a line of 4, as the ends move forward, the centers back up equally.
Use a couple handhold. If a new line is formed, immediately join hands in
the new line. From a line of 6 or 8, retain handholds in each half of the line.
As the very ends move forward, the very centers back up equally.
Adjust to end in facing lines.
</div>

<div class="comments full"><b>Comments</b>
<p>From a Tidal formation it is helpful, but not necessary, to say "Each Side".</p>
<p>A couple on the outside of the set (e.g., after a Couples Circulate 1 1/2) can be asked to Bend The Line.
In this case, they assume the other half of their line is towards the center of the set and, working as a
unit, turn 90 degrees to face the center of the set.</p>
</div>

<div class="full">
<h3>Case 2: Tidal Line (8 dancers)</h3>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b> Tidal Line</div>

Retain handholds in each half of the line. As the very ends move forward, the very centers back
up, equally. Adjust to Facing Lines at the end.</div>

<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
<p>From a line of 6, the call &quot;Lines of 6, Bend The Line&quot;
is also acceptable.</p>

<p>Attempts to get dancers to bend lines of 2 dancers
(e.g., Bend The Little Bitty Line) are considered very
unusual and should not be used.</p></div>
