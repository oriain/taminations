<h2>Eight Chain Thru</h2>

<div class="full">

<p>Starting formation - eight chain thru.
<span id="Part1"><span id="Part3"><span id="Part5"><span id="Part7">
Facing dancers join right hands and <a href="pull_by.html"> pull by</a>
</span></span></span></span>
(this completes an eight chain one).
<span id="Part2"><span id="Part4"><span id="Part6"><span id="Part8">
The center facing dancers join left hands and
<a href="pull_by.html"> pull by</a>
while the outside dancers do a
<a href="../b1/courtesy_turn.html"> courtesy turn</a>
</span></span></span></span>
(this completes an eight chain two). Repeat these actions in sequence to achieve eight
chain three, eight chain four, etc. Eight chain thru is the same as eight chain eight.
Even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) end in an eight chain thru formation. Odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7)
end in a trade by formation. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Use same styling as in  courtesy turn and  right and left grand. Emphasis should be placed on the courtesy turn in that portion of the basic so that dancers can maintain an eight chain thru formation and not be allowed to drift into a right and left grand type of movement.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 8 hands - 20; 4 hands - 10</p>
