<h2>Single Concept</h2>
<p>Single is a way to take an 8-dancer call and make it a 4-
dancer call; or to take a 4-dancer call and make it a 2-
dancer call.</p>
<p>In the Single version of a call, each dancer executes the
movement that would normally be done by a set of two
dancers within the normal version of the call. Hence, for
a call to have a Single version, it must be possible to
group all dancers into sets of two, in which the dancers in
each set are always facing the same direction throughout
the given call. The dancers in each set are usually dancing
their portion of the call As Couples, In Tandem, Once
Removed, or Twosome (or some combination of these
concepts).</p>
<p>You can think of Single as replacing each set of two
dancers with a single dancer located exactly half-way
between the two dancers. This single dancer then
executes the given call always staying on a path located
exactly half-way between where the two dancers would be
in the normal version of the call.</p>
