<title>Exchange the Box</title>

<h2>Exchange the Box</h2>
<p>Starting formation - 2 x 4 formation.</p>
<p>Do a total of four <a href="../b1/circulate.html">Split Circulates</a>,
except that when
you become an In-facing Center do your next
<a href="../b1/circulate.html">Circulate</a>
to your diagonal opposite position (crossing over into the
other Box). Exchange The Box can be fractionalized into
fourths. The traffic pattern is such that as you are crossing
to the other Box, you must physically stay to the outside of
those who are still in their original Box. The In-facing
Centers lead the Exchange and usually everyone else in
their Box can follow them.</p>
