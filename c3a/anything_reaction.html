<h2>Anything Reaction</h2>
<p>Starting formations - depends on the
"Anything" call</p>
<p>
<span class="Part1">Do the anything call leaving off the final
<a href="../plus/extend.html">Extend</a></span>, <span class="Part2">then do a
full <a href="../a1/chain_reaction.html">Chain Reaction</a></span>.</p>
<p>The anything call is usually a
<a href="../ms/scoot_back.html">Scoot Back</a>
variation of a
Tagging call. For example,</p>
<p>
<b>Flip Reaction</b>: From Parallel
Waves.
<a href="../c1/tagging_calls_back_to_a_wave.html">Flip Back</a>
Centers To A Wave then all
<a href="../a1/chain_reaction.html">Chain Reaction</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Tag Reaction</b>: From Parallel Lines.
<a href="../c1/tagging_calls_back_to_a_wave.html">Tag Back To A Wave</a>
Centers To A Wave then all Chain Reaction.</p>
<p>Note:
For Tagging calls, there is an unspoken 'Back' (Scoot Back)
in them (e.g., Tag Reaction means Tag Back Reaction).</p>
