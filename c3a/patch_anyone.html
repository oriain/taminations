<h2>Patch (the) Anyone</h2>
<p>Starting formation - A Couple or Mini-Wave.</p>
<p>
<a href="../ms/hinge.html">Hinge</a>; designated dancers
<a href="../b1/turn_back.html">U-Turn Back</a> in flow direction
(<a href="../plus/anything_and_roll.html">Roll</a> twice).
Ends in a Couple or Mini-Wave. This is a 2-part call.</p>
<p>Note: Determine who are the designated dancers before
doing the Hinge, not after. For example, from a Couple:
Patch The Beaus is a Partner Hinge (now both dancers
are Beaus) followed by original Beau U-Turn Back.
Similarly, from Parallel Lines: Patch The Ends refers to
the original Ends, not those who become Ends after the
Hinge.</p>
