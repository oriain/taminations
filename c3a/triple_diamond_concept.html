  <h2>Triple Diamond Concept</h2>
  <p>Triple Diamonds consist of three adjacent Diamond formations
    some of which have positions occupied by phantoms.</p>

  <p>The two most common types of Triple Diamonds are illustrated
    below.</p>

</p>
  <p>Triple Diamonds are analogous to Triple Boxes [C1] and Triple
    Waves/Lines/Columns [C2].</p>
  <p>Example: Triple Diamond, Flip The Diamond</p>

  <p>Triple Diamond calls are (4 or less)-dancer calls, requiring
    you to work only with the dancers in your Diamond. The historical
    application of 8-dancer calls such as Diamond Chain Thru is
    considered improper at C3A.</p>
